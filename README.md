## Introduction

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is widely used for system programming, developing operating systems, embedded systems, and various application software. This repository aims to provide a set of simple and basic C programs that cover fundamental concepts and help you get started with C programming.

## Programs

The repository includes the following basic C programs:

- Hello World
- Variables and Data Types
- Input and Output
- Control Flow Statements (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Structures
- File Handling

Each program is stored in a separate file with appropriate comments to explain the logic and functionality.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
